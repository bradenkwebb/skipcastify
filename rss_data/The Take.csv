"Nail-biting wins, devastating defeats at AFCON",https://aj.audio/TheTake-780,text/html,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 05:00:00 +0000","<p>Nigeria will square off against the Africa Cup of Nations host, Ivory Coast, capping a tournament that’s been full of surprises. Among them: the rise of South Africa and a nail-biting match that kept football fans guessing until the final whistle. South Africa’s wins, and then loss, follow its “moral victory” on the world stage at the International Court of Justice. So, how else did politics show up on the pitch?</p>

<p>ChatGPT is taking the world by storm with AI-generated text that rivals actual literature – but there’s a price. For its parent company, OpenAI, to get this quality product, human beings are paid to help teach it to identify the bad stuff: hate speech and violence of all kinds. We hear about the good, the bad, and the ugly of ChatGPT, including from one person who did the job and has real questions about whether it’s worth the price.</p>

Special episode: A new era of solidarity for the Palestinian cause,https://aj.audio/TheTake-672,text/html,"Tue, 24 Oct 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>Hundreds of activists filled the domed hall of the US Capitol last week to call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. In this roundtable discussion, we look at how activists are challenging mainstream narratives surrounding Palestine and Israel – both online and on the streets. What does solidarity look like for them? </p>

<p>An Israeli air strike hit Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday night, according to officials there. The Israeli military denies responsibility, but Gaza’s health ministry puts the blame squarely on them, saying at least 500 people are dead. The Palestinian Civil Defense said the attack was unprecedented. The hospital is in the area where the Israeli military had ordered all Palestinian residents to leave – prompting discussions of war crimes even before the air strike. So as Israel’s siege on Gaza continues, we ask the question: where is international law?</p>

It put a stop to weekly anti-government protests that threatened to topple a government among the most radical in its history, and for Israelis, it's prompted grief, outrage, and an unrestrained military response. Now, Israel’s military is preparing a record 300,000 army reservists for a ground war in Gaza. But anger over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's failure to protect its citizens remains. So as the country prepares for more conflict, where will that anger go?</p>

When this new law was first proposed last year, it was postponed because of the public outcry. But with Ukraine’s soldiers, volunteers and conscripts alike, going through months of grueling war, there’s a growing awareness in Ukraine that the country is in for the long haul. The optimism that the war could end this year is ebbing away. So, what does this law say about Ukraine's position in the war, and is it a sign of the changing role of women in Ukrainian society?</p>

"In the Taiwan Strait, tensions leave Kinmen with piles of garbage",https://aj.audio/TheTake-647,text/html,"Mon, 25 Sep 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>The archipelago of Kinmen in the Strait of Taiwan is small, barely visible on a map. Despite being under Taiwanese governance, it’s actually closer to the shores of mainland China, only a 30-minute ferry ride away. It’s been dealing with a garbage problem, with tons of trash washing up on its shores. But Kinmen has long been dealing with the consequences of Beijing and Taipei’s conflict, including recent military activity. So, where does this geopolitical dispute leave the Kinmenese?</p>

In the UK, banks closed more than 343,000 accounts in the last financial year. The practice is known as ‘debanking,’ and clients are given no notice or recourse after they’re flagged as potential risks. Muslim groups have complained for years that they are unfairly targeted. Their cause recently got an unexpected boost from far-right politician Nigel Farage after he uncovered that his account had also been shut down over his political beliefs. This week, the Financial Conduct Authority says a preliminary review has found ""no evidence"" that banks have shut or denied accounts over customers' political beliefs. But while Farage’s case drew widespread attention and condemnation, many in the Muslim community say they are still suffering the consequences.</p>

Musa al-Sadr, a revered figure in Lebanon’s Shia community, met with then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on August 31, 1978. He was never seen again. His mysterious disappearance has sparked decades of theories and accusations. In the hopes of finally forcing an answer, Lebanon has held Gaddafi’s youngest son, Hannibal, in prison since 2015 – though he’s never been tried. He’s now gone on a hunger strike, but Sadr’s family and devoted followers say there should be no concessions until they find out what happened to the ‘vanished Imam’.</p>

Gaddafi and Lebanon’s 'vanished Imam' that divided the Middle East,https://aj.audio/TheTake-626,text/html,"Fri, 25 Aug 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>It’s a story that brings together two powerful families in the Middle East. Musa al-Sadr, a revered figure in Lebanon’s Shia community, met with then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on August 31, 1978. He was never seen again. His mysterious disappearance has sparked decades of theories and accusations. In the hopes of finally forcing an answer, Lebanon has held Gaddafi’s youngest son, Hannibal, in prison since 2015 – though he’s never been tried. He’s now gone on a hunger strike, but Sadr’s family and devoted followers say there should be no concessions until they find out what happened to the ‘vanished Imam’.</p>

On the other side, Belarus has been furthering its alliance with Russia as the invasion in Ukraine continues. Now, fighters from the Wagner mercenary group have camped out in Belarus, leaving those in border villages in uncertainty and fear. In Poland, border guards and soldiers are growing in number, and the Polish government has cracked down on people who they say are illegally crossing the border. So, how has all the tension been affecting the locals? </p>

Among the destroyed areas is Lahaina, a historic city that served as the Kingdom of Hawaii’s capital in the 1800s.

What’s behind the spike in Fentanyl overdoses in Mexico?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-612,text/html,"Mon, 07 Aug 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>Fentanyl use and overdose deaths have long plagued the United States, but now Mexico is seeing a spike in overdoses from this potent opioid, with communities along the US-Mexico border being hit particularly hard. While the Mexican government still denies opioid use as a problem, those who suffer from addiction are facing stigma and a lack of public health support. The big question is: what’s being done to tackle the issue in Mexico?</p>

The US says it’s a necessary measure to help Ukraine protect itself — but the bombs, which are known to cause civilian deaths often, are banned by more than 100 countries. The Ukrainian government has promised that the weapons will not be used in populated areas, but there are already reports to the contrary.

For almost 30 years, the case has gone cold; police said there were no witnesses willing to come forward. Now, police are set to present evidence to a grand jury, after raiding a house belonging to Duane Keith Davis, known as Keefe D. Tupac’s lyrics criticizing police and his family’s background in the Black Panther Party may be reasons why the investigation stalled. But why revisit the case now?</p>

The long struggle to save Darfur,https://aj.audio/TheTake-591,text/html,"Fri, 07 Jul 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>Darfur’s years of systematic violence left the international community outraged – along with a few celebrities. And many of them tried to do something. They tried to save Darfur. At its peak, the Save Darfur movement would be an alliance of more than 190 faith-based organizations from many countries, a reported one million activists, and hundreds of community groups. But by 2016, the movement shut down. So, why did the movement fail – and what does it mean for the violence unleashed in Darfur today?</p>
<p><strong>This is the second of a two-part series on the crisis happening in Darfur. Listen to part one <a href=""http://aj.audio/TheTake-590"">here.</a></strong></p>

At least three sailboats have sunk in the past year. Now, it’s happened again off the Shetland Islands, the first ever in that area. There’ve been more than 200 reports of these types of encounters since 2020. And if you’ve been scrolling through your social media feed you might be on “team orca” or “team yacht.” The possible explanations for why, though, aren’t as clear cut as orcas wanting to take down billionaire boats. </p>

‘Orca uprising’: Why are orca whales targeting boats?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-584,text/html,"Wed, 28 Jun 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>Off the Portuguese coast in the Strait of Gibraltar, a pod of orca whales has been ramming commuter boats and ripping off boat rudders. At least three sailboats have sunk in the past year. Now, it’s happened again off the Shetland Islands, the first ever in that area. There’ve been more than 200 reports of these types of encounters since 2020. And if you’ve been scrolling through your social media feed you might be on “team orca” or “team yacht.” The possible explanations for why, though, aren’t as clear cut as orcas wanting to take down billionaire boats. </p>

On May 1st, a propeller plane carrying the children and three adults fell off the radar after engine failure. Two weeks later, the adults were found dead at the crash site, but the children were missing. A five-week-long search and rescue mission by the Colombian army alongside the Indigenous Guard ensued before rescuers finally found the children alive. Colombian government officials hailed their survival as nothing short of a miracle. The eldest of the children, who are of the Huitoto people, has been credited for their survival, using her indigenous knowledge of the rainforest to survive on fruits, seeds, and rainwater. And according to the indigenous people of the Amazon, the rainforest herself had a hand in helping the children survive.</p>

How 4 Indigenous Colombian children survived in the Amazon,https://aj.audio/TheTake-577,text/html,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>How did four indigenous children survive the Amazon jungle for 40 days after a deadly plane crash? On May 1st, a propeller plane carrying the children and three adults fell off the radar after engine failure. Two weeks later, the adults were found dead at the crash site, but the children were missing. A five-week-long search and rescue mission by the Colombian army alongside the Indigenous Guard ensued before rescuers finally found the children alive. Colombian government officials hailed their survival as nothing short of a miracle. The eldest of the children, who are of the Huitoto people, has been credited for their survival, using her indigenous knowledge of the rainforest to survive on fruits, seeds, and rainwater. And according to the indigenous people of the Amazon, the rainforest herself had a hand in helping the children survive.</p>

Since March 2022, the country’s murder rate has dropped by over half. But, in the process, the government arrested almost 70,000 people while suspending every citizen’s constitutional right to legal defense and allowing indefinite pre-trial detention. Despite El Salvador’s repressive new reality, Bukele and his policy remain extremely popular. Raising the question, is El Salvador becoming a police state?</p>

Journalist Jose Ruben Zamora, the president of Guatemalan newspaper El Periódico, was arrested almost a year ago. He’s reported on 144 investigative pieces about corruption in the Guatemalan government, led by President Alejandro Giammatei. Now he’s potentially facing 40 years in prison for what Guatemala’s government says is money laundering. The Committee to Protect Journalists has called Zamora’s detention “unwarranted.” And many government critics are saying this is part of a broader crackdown on anyone working to uncover corruption.</p>

Guatemalan journalist Jose Ruben Zamora could face 40 years in prison,https://aj.audio/TheTake-570,text/html,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>What does Jose Ruben Zamora’s arrest signify for Guatemala’s crackdown on dissent? Journalist Jose Ruben Zamora, the president of Guatemalan newspaper El Periódico, was arrested almost a year ago. He’s reported on 144 investigative pieces about corruption in the Guatemalan government, led by President Alejandro Giammatei. Now he’s potentially facing 40 years in prison for what Guatemala’s government says is money laundering. The Committee to Protect Journalists has called Zamora’s detention “unwarranted.” And many government critics are saying this is part of a broader crackdown on anyone working to uncover corruption.</p>

Moderation is a crucial but thankless job that requires being exposed to the worst parts of the internet. While AI is rapidly developing, it still relies on an army of humans to fine-tune the technology. But especially at outsourcing centers abroad, workers say their Big Tech employers aren’t doing enough to safeguard and support their mental health. The moderators' union was created after a former Facebook moderator in Kenya, Daniel Motaung, sued the social media giant and its subcontractor, saying his work in their Nairobi office caused him to suffer long-term mental trauma. </p>

Can Africa’s first content moderators union change Big Tech?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-557,text/html,"Mon, 22 May 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>It’s the first union of its kind on the continent for African content moderators. Moderation is a crucial but thankless job that requires being exposed to the worst parts of the internet. While AI is rapidly developing, it still relies on an army of humans to fine-tune the technology. But especially at outsourcing centers abroad, workers say their Big Tech employers aren’t doing enough to safeguard and support their mental health. The moderators' union was created after a former Facebook moderator in Kenya, Daniel Motaung, sued the social media giant and its subcontractor, saying his work in their Nairobi office caused him to suffer long-term mental trauma. </p>

The controversial policy known as Title 42 expired last week after three years. It allowed border authorities to reject people looking to seek asylum in the US on the spot and turn them back, on the grounds that they might be carrying COVID-19. The end of Title 42 has many expecting an increase in migration in the next few months, under the belief that it will now be easier for people to seek asylum in the US. But others believe the policy replacing Title 42 will actually be stricter.  So what does the end of Title 42 actually mean for people trying to get asylum in the United States?</p>

Independent investigations into the killing have found it was Israeli forces who shot her. After Israeli and US investigations found the killing was unintentional, Shireen’s family and colleagues continued to call for an independent investigation. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation announced an investigation in November, but it’s unclear where the probe stands. So what happened to that investigation, and will there ever be justice for Shireen Abu Akleh’s killing?</p>

Will there ever be justice for Shireen Abu Akleh?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-550,text/html,"Thu, 11 May 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>It’s been one year since Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed by Israeli forces while doing her job. Independent investigations into the killing have found it was Israeli forces who shot her. After Israeli and US investigations found the killing was unintentional, Shireen’s family and colleagues continued to call for an independent investigation. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation announced an investigation in November, but it’s unclear where the probe stands. So what happened to that investigation, and will there ever be justice for Shireen Abu Akleh’s killing?</p>

Reports of multi-faith representation and choir performances featuring refugee and LGBTQ singers will make this coronation distinctly different from those in the past. But the UK’s ongoing economic turmoil, controversial immigration policy, and race-related scandals within the royal family have all kept some Britons from feeling the inclusion.

The journey out of Sudan,https://aj.audio/TheTake-543,text/html,"Tue, 02 May 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>The way out of Sudan right now is long and dangerous, and hundreds of thousands of people are on the journey. Nisrin Elamin and her family, including her father, who’s approaching 90, were among those escaping the violence after two weeks of fighting between the Sudanese armed forces and the powerful paramilitary known as the Rapid Support Forces. The situation at Sudan’s borders is dire, but inside the country, there are widespread shortages and the violence threatens to increase. Nisrin tells us her story of leaving Sudan, and her worries for the family she left behind. </p>

<p>What does Russia’s digital draft mean for war?<strong> </strong>A spring offensive is looming in the war in Ukraine. Russia has already set in place greater restrictions on draft dodgers – suggesting that Russia may be preparing to launch another mass conscription order if it is not able to find enough volunteers. Before, conscripts had to be approached in person in order to be drafted, leading to videos of attempted draft dodgers being dragged unwillingly to enlistment. Now, the only thing standing between potential Russian military conscripts and war is an electronic message on a portal that’s become a major part of Russia’s digital infrastructure. </p>

It's all because of the region’s worst drought in more than 1,000 years. This summer, the US government is set to make some big decisions on who gets rights to the little water that remains – the states of the Colorado River basin and tribal nations. Many Native tribes have never shared the same rights as the states, and many reservations lack sufficient running water. Now, tribes are trying to change that, but they are afraid they may be left behind again. So what happens next in the West?</p>

What is lab-grown meat – and what is it not?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-528,text/html,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>‘Lab meat’ is popping up all over the world. Singapore was the first to introduce it to the public. The United States is now following suit with the Food and Drug Administration’s recent approval for lab-grown chicken. Governments and big companies are investing in and pushing laboratory-grown meat as the next big thing. Predictions are that if adopted, it could reduce methane, water and land use – all problems with industrial meat production. So how accurate are those predictions?</p>

Nearly 46,000 refugees and migrants arrived in the United Kingdom last year on small boats across the English Channel, a major increase from the year before. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says stopping the boats is a priority for the British people. But both the United Nations and the European Union have called the plan illegal for the way it would treat people fleeing war and persecution. Even Sunak’s Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, has acknowledged the plan may not be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. So why is the government pushing it forward?</p>

The attacks follow a speech by Tunisia’s President Kais Saied accusing African migrants of conspiring to make Tunisia more African and less Arab. This is the latest in a string of authoritarian moves by the President, and it has protesters back out in the street. But what will happen to the victims of this racism in the meantime?</p>

What’s behind the violent racist attacks in Tunisia?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-521,text/html,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 04:00:00 +0000","<p>The wave of racist violence sweeping Tunisia is unlike anything in recent memory. The attacks follow a speech by Tunisia’s President Kais Saied accusing African migrants of conspiring to make Tunisia more African and less Arab. This is the latest in a string of authoritarian moves by the President, and it has protesters back out in the street. But what will happen to the victims of this racism in the meantime?</p>

It has refused to condemn the fighting and, according to the US, is in negotiations to send weapons to the front lines. And the Chinese president seems to share a close friendship with Vladimir Putin. But at the same time, China is emerging from its zero-COVID lockdowns and trying to reach out again to the rest of the world. How will the world’s second-largest economy balance its competing interests, and what role can it play in bringing peace to Ukraine?</p>

"In Ukraine, photographers are on the information war's front line",https://aj.audio/TheTake-514,text/html,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 05:00:00 +0000","<p>Photographers have been the entire world’s lens into the Russia-Ukraine conflict for the past year. They’ve captured shocking scenes – from refugees and frontline battles, to portraits of bravery and resilience. But the photographers behind these images have also found themselves in the middle of an information war – to establish what’s really happening on the ground, and how this war will be seen in the future. </p>

Why hasn't Pakistan recovered from its catastrophic floods?,https://chrt.fm/track/383EG2/traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/9c074afa-3313-47e8-b802-a9f900789975/09af2160-238f-48b2-b20b-ad4b00ebd8e7/c8ef8192-fccd-4f90-8d5c-afb00158df58/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=b86dddc1-67a5-41c2-a13c-ad4b00ebd8f5,audio/mpeg,"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 05:00:00 +0000","<p>Pakistan is still reeling from last year’s deadly floods, which put a third of the country underwater.

But a new hope suddenly emerged late last month for families of the victims, when Judge Tarek Bitar reopened his dormant investigation into the blast, and into the leaders accused of letting it happen. Two days later, Lebanon’s Prosecutor General Ghassan Oweidat – one of those accused – issued his own charges against Bitar. Is this now the nail in the coffin for the blast investigation, or can the victims’ families still get justice?</p>

Will Lebanon ever see justice for the Beirut port blast?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-507,text/html,"Wed, 08 Feb 2023 05:00:00 +0000","<p>There’s been no accountability in the massive explosion at the Port of Beirut for more than two years. But a new hope suddenly emerged late last month for families of the victims, when Judge Tarek Bitar reopened his dormant investigation into the blast, and into the leaders accused of letting it happen. Two days later, Lebanon’s Prosecutor General Ghassan Oweidat – one of those accused – issued his own charges against Bitar. Is this now the nail in the coffin for the blast investigation, or can the victims’ families still get justice?</p>

Al Jazeera’s series, A Sense of Community, has travelled to four unique parts of the globe to explore the concept. We visited islanders in remote Scotland facing depopulation, explored the fight against crime and search for safety in the most dangerous neighbourhood in Mexico City, spoke with female runners in Kenya pushing back against gender-based violence, and delved into why Tibetans in Toronto are battling gentrification. All four communities face challenges in holding onto their culture and identity. While communities worldwide reckon with changes due to the pandemic, they also offer lessons about what makes a community worth preserving.</p>

Why do so few Israelis refuse the military draft?,https://chrt.fm/track/383EG2/traffic.omny.fm/d/clips/9c074afa-3313-47e8-b802-a9f900789975/09af2160-238f-48b2-b20b-ad4b00ebd8e7/9e85ea4a-7351-43ce-b281-af71013dda0b/audio.mp3?utm_source=Podcast&in_playlist=b86dddc1-67a5-41c2-a13c-ad4b00ebd8f5,audio/mpeg,"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 10:00:00 +0000","<p>The number of Israelis who openly refuse military service due to the occupation is low; earlier this year, four teenagers refusing together was notable. The low numbers persist despite multiple international human rights groups recognising Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid. Now, army violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank is at a high not seen in years, Israel’s most far-right government yet is on the verge of taking power, and draft refuser organisations say there has been increased interest in what is seen by most Israelis as a radical step. We hear from two men about why they did it, and why their decision is so rare.</p>

Refereeing with video replay can mean overturning goals, ejecting players, and plenty of moans and cheers. This time, VAR is back with semi-automation to determine if players are offside, with cameras and sensors tracking every limb on the pitch. When it was introduced for the first time at a World Cup in 2018, it changed the tournament – with passionate disagreement about whether that was for better or for worse.

<p>Lula, as he is known, will now attempt to roll back many of Bolsonaro’s right-wing policies - including the loosening of Brazil's gun-control measures, which led to the number of guns in private hands doubling since 2018. But how easy will that be?</p>

An American president in the Middle East,https://aj.audio/TheTake-430,text/html,"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 09:00:00 +0000","<p>US President Joe Biden has been to the Middle East many times, but never as head of state. Now he’s packing his bag to visit Saudi Arabia, a nation he once called a “pariah” after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But with US gas prices through the roof and low poll numbers, some analysts say trading human rights for economics could bring risks but also political rewards.  </p>

Revisiting Somalia in the face of famine,https://aj.audio/TheTake-422,text/html,"Fri, 24 Jun 2022 09:00:00 +0000","<p>Famine is a slow-moving disaster and when it is declared, people are typically dying of starvation already. It is too late to save every life. Much of Somalia is facing its third dry season which is killing crops, animals and people. The Take talks to Somalis trying to get the word out about what is happening in their country and what they hope will be done to save lives.</p>

The NRA's hold on the USA,https://aj.audio/TheTake-414,text/html,"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 09:00:00 +0000","<p>Mass shooting after mass shooting Americans cry out for gun control but more often than not, nothing is done. Why? Many Americans including President Joe Biden blame the gun lobby. We hear how America’s most influential lobbying organization changed tactics in the 1970’s and secret recordings that throw back the curtain on how they get business done.</p>

The election brought those issues to the forefront, and then paralyzed the Northern Irish government. As the UK tries to break the deadlock, it risks unraveling two decades of peace.</p>

Northern Ireland at a crossroads,https://aj.audio/TheTake-406,text/html,"Wed, 18 May 2022 09:00:00 +0000","<p>In Northern Ireland, it's gotten very complicated very quickly, after a historic election. The top party was Sinn Fein, a party that wants Northern Ireland out of the UK. Brexit has left the territory on a knife edge for years, and it all comes down to the Irish border. The election brought those issues to the forefront, and then paralyzed the Northern Irish government. As the UK tries to break the deadlock, it risks unraveling two decades of peace.</p>

This week marks the anniversary of Syria&rsquo;s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

"Ukraine, twice bitten",https://aj.audio/TheTake-370,text/html,"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 10:00:00 +0000","<p>Where is the nearest bomb shelter? Does it have water and supplies, or has it been turned into a restaurant? Before this week, many Ukrainians did not know the answers to these kinds of questions &ndash; and they still may not. Most Ukrainians have never thought a full scale invasion by Russia was coming. Now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, we&rsquo;re looking at how prepared they might be if it is.</p>

Who’s killing Mexican journalists?,https://aj.audio/TheTake-361,text/html,"Wed, 02 Feb 2022 10:00:00 +0000","<p>Just in the first month of 2022, four journalists were killed and two were attacked in Mexico.
