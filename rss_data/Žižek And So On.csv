<p>This week we're talking Mary Shelly, myth &amp; monstrosity, family, Freud and Frankenstein. For this episode, we've read &quot;History and family in Frankenstein” in Zizek's In Defense of Lost Causes. Why are stories so often posed through the motif of the family drama? Does the myth of the family distract from the real historical frame of the novel? Who coined the term <em>capitalist realism</em>? Is the mistake of calling the monster &quot;Frankenstein&quot; like calling a soda &quot;Coke&quot;? Enjoy!</p>

<p>This week we're talking Mary Shelly, myth &amp; monstrosity, family, Freud and Frankenstein. For this episode, we've read &quot;History and family in Frankenstein” in Zizek's In Defense of Lost Causes. Why are stories so often posed through the motif of the family drama? Does the myth of the family distract from the real historical frame of the novel? Who coined the term <em>capitalist realism</em>? Is the mistake of calling the monster &quot;Frankenstein&quot; like calling a soda &quot;Coke&quot;? Enjoy!</p>

Hegel and the Wound of Spirit,https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/zizekandsoon/episodes/Hegel-and-the-Wound-of-Spirit-e247caf,text/html,"Wed, 17 May 2023 13:53:16 GMT","UNLOCKED: Today we're talking Žižek's chapter in his book Absolute Recoil called ""The Violence of the Beginning"".

The reading begins with the notion that there is ""nothing prior to the loss"" of the sense of lost origins. Žižek then sets into play the idea of the self-alienation of spirit in the realm of translation to show the original brokenness of God Himself. 

We also question who the real James Bond is, hystericize Eliot's Prufrock, and discuss Emmanuel Carrere's novel The Moustache, all the while wondering—if we really meant what we said.

PREVIEW - Neofeudalism or Bust?,https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/zizekandsoon/episodes/PREVIEW---Neofeudalism-or-Bust-e1bfvbd,text/html,"Thu, 09 Dec 2021 17:47:53 GMT","<p>For our patreon subscribers: https://www.patreon.com/zizekandsoon</p>
<p>After a harrowing month, we reassemble to reassess the assemblage of today's capitalism. But first, have you seen the new Beatles doc?</p>
<p>In a recent article, Zizek has used the term ""neofeudalism"" to describe new dynamics of capitalism. We go back to the source for this terminology—an article by Jodi Dean—and discuss whether the term is more useful in diagnosing features of political economy than (a critique of) capitalism. Then we move on to Zizek's recent article in Philosophical salon and talk about water fountains, Bane, China, and continuing a critique of capitalism that keeps up with new and emergent forces.</p>

We dive into two recent articles from the Philosophical Salon. The first is by Fabio Vighi, who charges Žižek with capitulating too easily to new forms of social domination with his acceptance of lockdowns. Vighi argues that we now live “in a neo-feudal inferno where our Lords enslave us in order to protect us, and protect us in order to enslave us.” In his response<strong>, </strong>Žižek charges Vighi with missing the crucial lesson that the “brutal reality of the pandemic [is] a contingent event,” not some mega-plot knowingly developed and orchestrated by the establishment. The argument laid out by Vighi is, Žižek argues, dangerously close to a paranoid conspiracy theory. Following Žižek, we discuss how Vighi’s position is maintained by the fantasy of a consistent ordering of the antagonism at the heart of the social and the symbolic order.</p>

We locate the origin of the term somewhere in-between the thought of Žižek’s and Robert Pfaller. Referring to texts of each, we &nbsp;define interpassivity within the scope of Althussier’s influence in the 90s, as the immanent response/critique to the prevailing ideology of “interactivity”. We discuss a few infamous examples of interpassivity from Žižek’s texts like “canned laughter” and “TiVo”, and consider how interpassivity structures the subject’s relating to the Other as the subject supposed to know, believe, and enjoy. &nbsp;We also try to think through the constitutive role interpassivity plays in the subject/object relation, and how this might furnish an anti-ideological position – or, a secondary ideology that does not rest on becoming a subject, and liberates us from the injunction to “enjoy!” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Referring to texts of each, we &nbsp;define interpassivity within the scope of Althussier’s influence in the 90s, as the immanent response/critique to the prevailing ideology of “interactivity”. We discuss a few infamous examples of interpassivity from Žižek’s texts like “canned laughter” and “TiVo”, and consider how interpassivity structures the subject’s relating to the Other as the subject supposed to know, believe, and enjoy. &nbsp;We also try to think through the constitutive role interpassivity plays in the subject/object relation, and how this might furnish an anti-ideological position – or, a secondary ideology that does not rest on becoming a subject, and liberates us from the injunction to “enjoy!” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>N.B. This episode marks the anniversary of &amp;SoOn. We want to thank all of you – and especially our patrons – for listening, supporting, and engaging with us this past year.

Todd brings us through what he argues is the essential role of desire in capitalism—not as something which is repressed by the system, as many have argued, but rather how capitalism perpetuates itself through the very structure of desire. Without coming to terms with this, he says, any attempt to formulate a new system, or find the exit from capitalism, plays into the terms capitalism lays out in the form of “the promise.”</p>

Parallax is “the apparent displacement of an object” wherein the observed difference is not simply relativized, but rather inscribed as a gap into the relation between subject and object. We find examples of the parallax view in the Coen brothers’ film <em>Burn After Reading</em>, and Coppola’s <em>The Conversation</em>; and consider Kant’s designation of phenomena and noumena as setting the framework through which to consider the parallax shift in Hegel’s notion of the subject. We also touch on Heidegger’s “ontological difference”, Lacan’s <em>objet petit a</em> as a parallax object, and the parallax as the very method by which these figures are read by Žižek.</p>

After discussing the finer points of a Lacano-Helgelian critique of Buddhism, the fellas get into Zizek's other major critiques of Western Buddhism; its associations with science and capitalism. Towards this, Zizek writes that Buddhism is perhaps the ideal religion for capitalism and for the CEOs of Silicon Valley, since it's prescription to withdraw from the world, and to see it and one's self as illusory, does little to change the system of oppression itself, and assures the passive acceptance of hegemonic realism.</p>

This episode, we take another stab at our failed attempt to talk about Žižek and film. Earlier in the week we spoke to Dr. Matthew Flisfeder, the author of <em>The Symbolic, the Sublime, and Slavoj Žižek's Theory of Film</em>— but we forgot to record the conversation... So, in our second attempt to tackle this crucial topic in Žižek's work, we talk about Matthew's book, as well as ""The Pervert's Guide to Cinema"", the choice between reality and illusion, the <em>third pill</em>, Hitchcock's MacGuffin, the parallax object, and wonder <em>why film</em>?</p>

In the interview Žižek parses out what he calls the “post-modern deadlock.” This theoretical and political impasse, specific to the epoch of post modernism, is the product of a tension between what he identifies as the broad realist approach and the transcendental. In exploring this deadlock, Žižek speaks about the limits of Marx’s historical materialism, Judith Butler’s gender theory, and Lacanian psychoanalysis, each as separate examples of transhistorical ontology. Beyond this impasse, and in response to the current global situation, Žižek proposes historicizing historicism, in the practice of Hegel, so that we might see the emergence of an immanent, yet entirely new version of utopia, and that in the event of the catastrophic, there is something at work which is both potentially emancipatory, and universal."
