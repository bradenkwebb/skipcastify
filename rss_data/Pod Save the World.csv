World Corrupt Episode 1: A Toxic Love Affair between Politics and Sports,https://crooked.com,text/html,"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 07:00:00 +0000","This fall, when the eyes of the world turn towards Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a shadow looms over the tournament, which is one of the most watched events in the world. The sports landscape being co-opted for geo-political and corporate gain is nothing new, but this year's iteration of football's biggest competition may be the most expensive example to date.
